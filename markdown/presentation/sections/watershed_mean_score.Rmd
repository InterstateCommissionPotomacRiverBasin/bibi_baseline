## Watershed Mean Score {.smaller}

__Process__

1. Chessie BIBI scores are aggregated by a spatial unit (HUC8, HUC10, HUC12, or catchment)
    + What is an appropriate number of samples to accurately represent a spatial unit cell?
    + Any spatial unit cells without the appropriate number samples are classified as "Insufficient"
2. The mean Chessie BIBI score is calculated for each spatial unit cell
3. Each spatial unit cell is assigned a rating based on the mean score
4. Find the number of stream miles represented in each spatial unit cell
5. The spatial unit cell rating is weighted by the number of stream miles
6. Summarize the proportion of stream miles representing Acceptable, Fair, Degraded, and Insufficient at the Chesapeake Bay basin level
